## PptxDocument

![CanvasNetPptx Structure](CanvasNetPptxView.svg)

<!-- cspell:ignore ooxml pptx -->

`PptxDocument` is distributed as the separate `DemaConsulting.CanvasNet.Pptx` NuGet package
(namespace `DemaConsulting.CanvasNet.Pptx`), which references the core `DemaConsulting.CanvasNet`
package.

The `PptxDocument` class is the sole software unit of the `CanvasNetPptx` system. As of Phase 1a,
its dependencies are limited to the .NET base class library's `System.IO.Compression.ZipArchive`
(reading the `.pptx` ZIP container) and `System.Xml.Linq` (parsing `[Content_Types].xml` and each
`.rels` relationships part) — no `CanvasNet` core-system type is used yet (see _CanvasNetPptx
System Design_'s Dependencies section, `../canvas-net-pptx.md`).

### Package Layer (Phase 1a)

A `.pptx` file is an OOXML (Office Open XML) package: a ZIP archive whose parts are discovered by
following a chain of relationships, starting from the package root. `PptxDocument.Package.cs`
implements this generic package layer, independent of any presentation-specific semantics:

- **Opening the ZIP archive**: the private constructor buffers the entire input stream into a
  byte array, wraps it in a non-writable `MemoryStream`, and opens that stream as a read-only
  `ZipArchive`. Any failure to do so - an unreadable or corrupt (non-ZIP) stream - is wrapped in
  `InvalidDataException` (`ZipArchive`'s own constructor already throws this type for a corrupt
  archive; other failure shapes, such as `IOException`/`ArgumentException`/`NotSupportedException`/
  `EndOfStreamException`, are caught and re-thrown wrapped in the same type, so every
  package-layer failure is uniformly `InvalidDataException`).
- **`[Content_Types].xml` resolution**: parsed once, at construction time, into two lookups - a
  case-insensitive `Default` extension-to-content-type map (for example `"xml"` ->
  `"application/xml"`) and an exact-match `Override` part-path-to-content-type map (for example
  `"ppt/presentation.xml"` -> `"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.
  presentation.main+xml"`). `ResolvePart(string partPath)` consults the override map first,
  falling back to the default map keyed by the part's file extension, and throws
  `InvalidDataException` when the package does not contain the requested part, or when neither
  map resolves a content type for it.
- **Relationship resolution**: the package-level relationships (`_rels/.rels`) are parsed eagerly
  at construction time (so a malformed package-level relationships part fails fast at `Open()`
  time), while every other part's own relationships (`{dir}/_rels/{partName}.rels`) are parsed
  lazily, on first access, and cached. `ResolveRelationship(string sourcePartPath, string
  relationshipId)` (the empty string for `sourcePartPath` denotes the package root) looks up the
  given relationship ID within the source part's own relationships, then resolves its `Target`
  attribute per OPC's relative-reference rules: a target beginning with `'/'` is resolved relative
  to the package root; any other target is resolved relative to the source part's own directory,
  with `"."`/`".."` segments in the combined path normalized away exactly like a familiar
  filesystem path (so, for example, `ppt/slides/slide1.xml`'s relationship to
  `"../slideLayouts/slideLayout1.xml"` resolves to `"ppt/slideLayouts/slideLayout1.xml"`, not
  `"ppt/slides/slideLayouts/slideLayout1.xml"`). An unknown relationship ID, a relationship whose
  `TargetMode` is `"External"` (not supported this phase), or a target that would traverse past
  the package root (more `".."` segments than preceding directory segments) all throw
  `InvalidDataException`.

**Phase 1a scope boundary**: no presentation-specific part (`ppt/presentation.xml`, a slide, a
slide layout/master) is itself interpreted - `ResolvePart`/`ResolveRelationship` only resolve a
part's content type and a relationship's target path, both of which are generic OPC package
concepts. The `_entriesByPath`/`_defaultContentTypes`/`_overrideContentTypes`/
`_relationshipCache` fields hold the entirety of this phase's parsed state.

### Public API (Phase 1a)

`PptxDocument.cs` implements the sealed, `IDisposable` public surface:

- **`Open(Stream stream)`**: validates `stream` is non-null (`ArgumentNullException`), buffers it
  fully into a byte array via `CopyTo` (so the caller's stream need not remain open or seekable
  afterward, exactly like `PdfDocument.Open`'s own buffering pattern), and constructs a new
  `PptxDocument` from the buffered bytes.
- **`Open(string path)`**: validates `path` is non-null (`ArgumentNullException`) and not
  empty/whitespace-only (`ArgumentException`), then opens a `FileStream` and delegates to
  `Open(Stream)`.
- **`Dispose()`**: idempotent (a `_disposed` flag guards a second call from re-disposing already-
  released resources); disposes the underlying `ZipArchive` and its backing `MemoryStream`.
