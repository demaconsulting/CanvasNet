# Introduction

This document provides the verification design for CanvasNet, a .NET library
providing a canvas-based drawing and rendering API.

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to serve as the verification design entry point and document how
requirements will be tested across all software items in the CanvasNet system. This
documentation enables formal review by mapping every requirement to named test scenarios, supports
compliance auditing by providing clear traceability from requirements through verification design
to tests, and ensures test completeness can be assessed without reading implementation code.

This document is intended for:

- Software developers implementing and maintaining tests
- Code reviewers validating test completeness against requirements
- Compliance auditors tracing requirements through verification design to tests
- Quality assurance teams validating test coverage and scenario adequacy

## Scope

This document covers the verification design for the CanvasNet system and its
constituent software items, specifically:

- **CanvasNet (System)** — The complete .NET library system
- **Canvas (Subsystem)** — Pixel-buffer primitives: the `Surface` unit (mutable, in-memory
  32-bit RGBA pixel buffer with span-based row access) and the `Rgba32` unit
- **Codecs (Subsystem)** — Image format codecs: `BmpCodec`, `PngCodec`, `TiffCodec`, and
  `JpegCodec`, each converting to and from a `Surface` pixel buffer

The following OTS items are also covered:

- **BuildMark** — build-notes documentation tool
- **FileAssert** — document assertion tool
- **Pandoc** — Markdown-to-HTML conversion tool
- **ReqStream** — requirements traceability tool
- **ReviewMark** — file review enforcement tool
- **SarifMark** — SARIF report conversion tool
- **SonarMark** — SonarCloud quality report tool
- **VersionMark** — tool-version documentation tool
- **WeasyPrint** — HTML-to-PDF conversion tool
- **xUnit** — unit-testing framework

This verification documentation covers the same software items as the design documentation.

Version applicability: This verification design applies to all versions of CanvasNet.

The following topics are explicitly excluded from this verification documentation:

- Build pipeline and CI/CD process testing
- Infrastructure and hosting environment testing

## Companion Artifact Structure

Each software item covered by this document has corresponding artifacts in parallel directory
trees. In-house items have artifacts in these parallel locations:

- Requirements: `docs/reqstream/{system}/.../{item}.yaml` (kebab-case)
- Design docs: `docs/design/{system}/.../{item}.md` (kebab-case)
- Verification design: `docs/verification/{system}/.../{item}.md` (kebab-case)
- Source code: `src/{System}/.../{Item}.cs` (PascalCase for C#)
- Tests: `test/{System}.Tests/.../{Item}Tests.cs` (PascalCase for C#)

OTS items have parallel artifacts in:

- Requirements: `docs/reqstream/ots/{ots-name}.yaml` (kebab-case)
- Verification: `docs/verification/ots/{ots-name}.md` (kebab-case)

Review-sets: defined in `.reviewmark.yaml`
