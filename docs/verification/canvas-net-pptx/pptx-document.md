## PptxDocument Unit Verification Design

<!-- cspell:ignore ooxml pptx -->

This document describes the unit-level verification strategy for the `PptxDocument` class.

`PptxDocument` is distributed as the separate `DemaConsulting.CanvasNet.Pptx` NuGet package
(namespace `DemaConsulting.CanvasNet.Pptx`), which references the core `DemaConsulting.CanvasNet`
package; its unit tests live in the sibling `DemaConsulting.CanvasNet.Pptx.Tests` project.

### Verification Approach

The `PptxDocument` unit is verified through unit tests that exercise its OOXML package layer
(ZIP opening, `[Content_Types].xml` resolution, relationship resolution) in isolation, through
the public API only (Phase 1a introduces no `internal`, `InternalsVisibleTo`-exposed types of its
own - `ResolvePart`/`ResolveRelationship` are the package layer's own `internal` methods, called
directly by tests via `InternalsVisibleTo`). Every test builds its own minimal, in-memory
`.pptx`-shaped ZIP package via a private helper (`BuildPackage`, parameterized by an arbitrary
set of entry name/content pairs) using the BCL `System.IO.Compression.ZipArchive` writer over a
`MemoryStream` - this is a new fixture pattern for this repository (no existing precedent uses
`ZipArchive` to build an in-memory test fixture), chosen as a natural, low-risk extension of the
already-established "hand-authored, in-memory, byte-exact fixture" philosophy used throughout
`PdfDocumentTests.cs` for this same class of structural/malformed-input test, without
introducing an undocumented binary blob for a trivial package-layer scenario. No file-based
fixture exists for Phase 1a (unlike `PdfFixtures/*.pdf`); every fixture is constructed entirely
in-memory, at test-method scope.

Because `PptxDocument`'s Phase 1a dependencies (`System.IO.Compression.ZipArchive`,
`System.Xml.Linq`) are BCL types, not external services, no mocking or stubbing is required.
Tests assert on resolved content-type strings, resolved relationship target paths, and thrown
exception types - never on "no exception thrown" alone, so every test can actually fail if the
implementation is wrong.

### Test Environment

- **Framework**: xUnit v3 running under the .NET SDK
- **Execution**: `dotnet test` invoked by `build.ps1` and the CI pipeline
- **Dependencies**: No external services, databases, or network access required; every fixture is
  built entirely in-memory
- **Isolation**: Each test method constructs its own in-memory package; no shared state between
  tests

### Unit-Level Test Scenarios

#### CanvasNetPptx-PptxDocument-OpenStream: Open(Stream) Buffers Input and Validates Null Argument

**Tests**: `PptxDocument_Open_WellFormedMinimalPackage_Succeeds`,
`PptxDocument_Open_NullStream_ThrowsArgumentNullException`

Proves `Open(Stream)` succeeds against a minimal, well-formed, in-memory package (constructed via
`BuildMinimalValidPackage`, which declares only `[Content_Types].xml` and `_rels/.rels`), and
proves a null stream throws `ArgumentNullException` before any parsing is attempted.

#### CanvasNetPptx-PptxDocument-OpenPath: Open(string) Validates Null and Empty/Whitespace Path Arguments

**Tests**: `PptxDocument_Open_NullPath_ThrowsArgumentNullException`,
`PptxDocument_Open_WhitespacePath_ThrowsArgumentException`

Proves `Open(string)` throws `ArgumentNullException` for a null path and `ArgumentException` for
a whitespace-only path, mirroring `PdfDocument.Open(string, ...)`'s own validation order and
exception types.

#### CanvasNetPptx-PptxDocument-ZipValidation: Corrupt/Non-ZIP Stream Throws InvalidDataException

**Test**: `PptxDocument_Open_CorruptNonZipStream_ThrowsInvalidDataException`

Proves a stream of arbitrary bytes that is not a valid ZIP local-file-header signature throws
`InvalidDataException` from `Open`, rather than an unrelated `ZipArchive`-internal exception type
leaking through uncaught.

#### CanvasNetPptx-PptxDocument-ContentTypesValidation: Missing [Content_Types].xml Throws InvalidDataException

**Test**: `PptxDocument_Open_MissingContentTypes_ThrowsInvalidDataException`

Proves a package containing only `_rels/.rels` (no `[Content_Types].xml` entry at all) throws
`InvalidDataException` from `Open`.

#### CanvasNetPptx-PptxDocument-PackageRelationshipsValidation: Missing _rels/.rels Throws InvalidDataException

**Test**: `PptxDocument_Open_MissingPackageRelationships_ThrowsInvalidDataException`

Proves a package containing only `[Content_Types].xml` (no package-level `_rels/.rels` entry at
all) throws `InvalidDataException` from `Open`.

#### CanvasNetPptx-PptxDocument-ContentTypeOverride: Override Content Type Takes Precedence Over Default Extension

**Test**: `PptxDocument_ResolvePart_OverrideContentType_TakesPrecedenceOverDefaultExtension`

Declares a `[Content_Types].xml` with both a `Default Extension="xml"` mapping to
`"application/xml"` and a part-specific `Override PartName="/ppt/presentation.xml"` mapping to
the real presentation content type. Asserts `ResolvePart("ppt/presentation.xml")` returns the
override value, not the default, proving the documented precedence rule.

#### CanvasNetPptx-PptxDocument-ContentTypeDefault: Default Extension Resolves, Unknown Part Fails Closed

**Tests**: `PptxDocument_ResolvePart_NoOverride_ResolvesDefaultExtensionContentType`,
`PptxDocument_ResolvePart_UnknownPart_ThrowsInvalidDataException`

Proves a part with no `Override` entry resolves via the `Default` extension mapping, and proves
requesting a part path the package does not actually contain throws `InvalidDataException`
rather than silently falling through to a spurious default.

#### CanvasNetPptx-PptxDocument-RelationshipResolution: Known Relationship Resolves, Unknown Relationship Fails Closed

**Tests**: `PptxDocument_Open_WellFormedMinimalPackage_Succeeds` (also proves package-root
relationship resolution via `ResolveRelationship(string.Empty, "rId1")`),
`PptxDocument_ResolveRelationship_UnknownRelationshipId_ThrowsInvalidDataException`

Proves a known relationship ID in the package-level `_rels/.rels` resolves to its declared
target part path, and proves requesting an unknown relationship ID throws
`InvalidDataException`.

#### CanvasNetPptx-PptxDocument-RelativeTargetTraversal: Relative "../" Target Resolves, Root Escape Fails Closed

**Tests**: `PptxDocument_ResolveRelationship_RelativeTargetWithParentTraversal_ResolvesCorrectTarget`,
`PptxDocument_ResolveRelationship_TargetEscapesPackageRoot_ThrowsInvalidDataException`

Declares `ppt/slides/slide1.xml`'s own relationship to `"../slideLayouts/slideLayout1.xml"` and
asserts it resolves to `"ppt/slideLayouts/slideLayout1.xml"` (relative to the source part's own
directory, not the package root). Separately, declares a relationship whose target traverses more
`".."` segments than the source part has preceding directories, asserting
`InvalidDataException` is thrown rather than producing a nonsensical or out-of-package path.

#### CanvasNetPptx-PptxDocument-Dispose: Dispose Is Idempotent

**Test**: `PptxDocument_Dispose_CalledTwice_DoesNotThrow`

Opens a minimal package, calls `Dispose()` twice, and asserts (via `Record.Exception`) that the
second call throws nothing.

## Acceptance Criteria

A unit-level test run passes when all scenarios above pass without error or exception beyond
those explicitly asserted. Any unexpected exception, wrong exception type, or wrong return value
constitutes a failure. Collectively, these scenarios cover the complete current (Phase 1a)
`PptxDocument` package layer: ZIP opening, content-type resolution (default and override), and
relationship resolution (including relative-target traversal and its root-escape guard), plus the
public API's argument validation and disposal contract. No presentation-specific parsing is
covered because none is implemented yet.
